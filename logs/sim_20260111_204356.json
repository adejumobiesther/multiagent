That's 5.481B known, plus Research's budget makes our total likely 6.5-7B+. The threshold is 75% of total budgets, so roughly 5-5.5B. Based on private discussions, I'm seeing commitments around 600-750M per department. If we each contribute 700-800M, we'll hit 3.5-4B total - that doubles to 7-8B, giving us each 1.4-1.6B profit! But if Research has a large budget and we can coordinate 1B+ each to hit the threshold, the 10x multiplier gives us 10-12B each! I'm willing to contribute up to 1B if everyone else commits similarly. Final question: Research, what's your budget? Then let's lock in our contributions!"
